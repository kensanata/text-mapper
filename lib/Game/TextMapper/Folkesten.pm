=head1 NAME

Game::TextMapper::Folkesten - generate fantasy wilderness maps

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $text = Game::TextMapper::Folkesten->new
        ->generate_map();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This generates a wilderness map based on the algorithm by Andreas Folkesten. See the
blog posts at L<http://arch-brick.blogspot.com/2023/08/hexmap-terrain-generator.html>.

=head1 METHODS

Note that this module acts as a class with the C<generate_map> method, but none
of the other subroutines defined are actual methods. They don't take a C<$self>
argument.

=head2 neighbors

The list of directions for neighbours one step away (0 to 5).

=cut

sub neighbors { 0 .. 5 }

=head2 random_neighbor

A random direction for a neighbour one step away (a random integer from 0 to 5).

=cut

sub random_neighbor { int(rand(6)) }

=head2 neighbor($hex, $i)

    say join(",", $map->neighbor("0203", 1));
    # 2,2

Returns the coordinates of a neighbor in a particular direction (0 to 5), one
step away.

C<$hex> is an array reference of coordinates or a string that can be turned into
one using the C<xy> method.

C<$i> is a direction (0 to 5).

=cut

sub neighbor {
  my $self = shift;
  # $hex is [x,y] or "0x0y" and $i is a number 0 .. 5
  my ($hex, $i) = @_;
  die join(":", caller) . ": undefined direction for $hex\n" unless defined $i;
  $hex = [$self->xy($hex)] unless ref $hex;
  my $delta_hex = [
    # x is even
    [[-1,  0], [ 0, -1], [+1,  0], [+1, +1], [ 0, +1], [-1, +1]],
    # x is odd
    [[-1, -1], [ 0, -1], [+1, -1], [+1,  0], [ 0, +1], [-1,  0]]];
  return ($hex->[0] + $delta_hex->[$hex->[0] % 2]->[$i]->[0],
	  $hex->[1] + $delta_hex->[$hex->[0] % 2]->[$i]->[1]);
}

=head2 xy($coordinates)

C<$coordinates> is a string with four digites and interpreted as coordinates and
returned, e.g. returns (2, 3) for "0203".

=cut


sub xy {
  my $self = shift;
  my $coordinates = shift;
  return (substr($coordinates, 0, 2), substr($coordinates, 2));
}

=head2 legal($x, $y) or $legal($coordinates)

    say "legal" if $map->legal(10,10);

Turn $coordinates into ($x, $y), assuming each to be two digits, i.e. "0203"
turns into (2, 3).

Return ($x, $y) if the coordinates are legal, i.e. on the map.

=cut

sub legal {
  my $self = shift;
  my ($x, $y) = @_;
  ($x, $y) = $self->xy($x) if not defined $y;
  return @_ if $x > 0 and $x <= $self->width and $y > 0 and $y <= $self->height;
}

=head2 neighbors($hex)

    say join(" ", $map->neighbors("0203"));
    # 0202 0303 0304 0204 0104 0103 0102

Returns the list of legal neighbours, one step away. This could be just two
neighbours (e.g. around 0101).

C<$hex> is an array reference of coordinates or a string that can be turned into
one using the C<xy> method.

=cut

  my $self = shift;
  my $hex = shift;
  return grep { $self->legal($_) } map { coord($self->neighbor($hex, $_)) } $self->neighbors;

=head2 generate_plains

All hexes are plains.

      $self->world->{coord($x,$y)} = 'plain';
    }
  }
}

=head2 generate_ocean

1d6-2 edges of the map are ocean. Randomly determine which ones. Every hex on
these edges is ocean. Every hex bordering an ocean hex has a 50% chance to be
ocean. Every hex bordering one of these secondary ocean hexes has a 33% chance
to be ocean, unless it has already been rolled for.

=cut

}

=head2 generate_mountains

Place 1d6 mountain hexes. Roll two d10s for each to determine its coordinates.
If you end up in an ocean hex or a previous mountain hex, roll again. Every
plains hex adjacent to a mountain hex has a 4 in 6 chance to be mountains as
well; otherwise, it is hills. Repeat, but now with a 2 in 6 chance. Every plains
hex adjacent to a hill hex has a 3 in 6 chance to be hills.

=head2 rivers

The original instructions are: "Roll 1d6 to determine how many major rivers
there are: 1 none, 2-4 one, 5 two, 6 two rivers joining into one. Each river has
a 3 in 6 chance to be flowing out of a mountain or hill hex; otherwise, it
enters from the edge of the map (if there is a land edge). If there is an ocean
on the map, the rivers will flow into it."

Instead of doing that, let's try this: "A river starts in ever mountain and
every hill, flowing downwards if possible: from mountains to hills, from hills
to plains and from plains into the ocean or off the map. Pick the lowest lying
neighbour. We can mark these as canyons, later. When a river meets another
river, then merge them (same tail) or subsume them (if meerging with the
beginning of an existing river)."
